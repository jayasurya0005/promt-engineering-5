## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Background

Large Language Models have transformed how humans interact with artificial intelligence. Unlike traditional programming paradigms requiring formal coding languages, LLMs can interpret natural language instructions. However, the quality, accuracy, and usefulness of AI-generated outputs depend significantly on how users frame their requests. This practice, known as "prompting," has evolved into various established patterns, each with distinct characteristics and applications.

### 1.2 Purpose and Scope

This report aims to:
- Identify and categorize major prompting patterns currently in use
- Establish objective criteria for evaluating prompting effectiveness
- Compare the performance of different prompting patterns across standardized test scenarios
- Provide evidence-based recommendations for selecting appropriate prompting methods based on task requirements

### 1.3 Methodology

Our analysis employed both qualitative and quantitative methods to evaluate prompting patterns:
- Literature review of research papers on prompt engineering
- Controlled experiments with identical tasks across different prompting patterns
- Measurement of objective metrics including response accuracy, completeness, creativity, and adherence to instructions
- Analysis of scenarios where certain patterns significantly outperformed others

## 2. Classification of Prompting Patterns

### 2.1 Direct Instruction Prompting

**Description**: The most straightforward approach, where the user provides a clear, direct instruction.

**Structure**: "Think step by step" instructions

**Example**:
```
The Browns family has 5 children. Each child has twice as many toys as their age in years. 
The children are aged 3, 5, 7, 8, and 10. How many toys do they have altogether? 
Think through this step by step before providing the final answer.
```

**Characteristics**:
- Enhances logical reasoning capabilities
- Reduces mathematical and reasoning errors
- Provides transparency into the AI's decision-making process

### 2.6 Zero-Shot Prompting
